# Day 15 – Debugging Skills (Debugging Section after Day 12)

**Udemy days to assign:**

* The **Debugging module** – "Describe the Problem", "Reproduce the Bug", debugger, Odd/Even, Leap Year, FizzBuzz debugging.

**Robotics project:**
🛠 **Debug the Broken Robot Script**

* You give them a pre-written but buggy script that:

  * Simulates robot movement
  * Occasionally crashes or gives wrong positions.
* They must use print debugging / debugger to find and fix logical errors.

**1-hour lesson:**

* Demo using a debugger (breakpoints, stepping).
* Show a typical off-by-one or wrong comparison in movement code.

**1-hour work:**

* Students debug the provided script.
* Stretch: have them write a short "post-mortem" on what the bug was and how they found it.
