# Day 11 – CSV & Simple Data Analysis (Udemy Day 25)

**Udemy days to assign:**

* **Day 25** – reading CSV with Pandas, Squirrel Census, U.S. States Game.

**Robotics project (replace Squirrel Census / States Game):**
🛠 **Robot Sensor Log Analyzer (CSV)**

* Prepare a small CSV of "robot runs" (timestamp, distance, battery, errors).
* Use pandas to:

  * Load CSV
  * Compute averages and counts
  * Filter e.g. runs where battery dropped below threshold.

**1-hour lesson:**

* Show minimal pandas: `read_csv`, selecting columns, `value_counts`, `mean`.

**1-hour work:**

* Students write **Sensor Log Analyzer**.
* Stretch: save a summary CSV of "bad" runs only.
