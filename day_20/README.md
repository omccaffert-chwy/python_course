# Day 20 – Capstone & Portfolio (Udemy Day 81 Project List)

**Udemy days to assign:**

* **Day 81 section** – Text to Morse, Portfolio website, Tic Tac Toe, etc.
  (Use mainly as inspiration.)

**Robotics project:**
🛠 **Capstone: Robot Control & Analysis Tool**
You let students **pick 1 of 2 paths**:

1. **Simulation path:**

   * Expand the Turtle robot simulator into a multi-screen "app":

     * live control
     * logging
     * replaying past missions.

2. **Data analysis path:**

   * Build a richer **sensor log dashboard**:

     * load CSV logs
     * compute statistics
     * show plots (if you're okay going slightly beyond what you scheduled).

**1-hour lesson:**

* Help them scope the capstone.
* Discuss how to present the project (README, screenshots, short demo).

**1-hour work:**

* Students work on capstone.
* Stretch: push to GitHub and write a short project description.
