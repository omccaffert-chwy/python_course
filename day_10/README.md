# Day 10 – Files & Logging (Udemy Day 24)

**Udemy days to assign:**

* **Day 24** – file read/write, high score in Snake, mail merge.

**Robotics project (replace Snake high score / Mail merge):**
🛠 **Robot Mission Log**

* After each simulated "mission", append results (tasks completed, energy used, success/fail) to a text file.
* On start, read and show last N missions.

**1-hour lesson:**

* Introduce `open()`, `with`, read vs write vs append.
* Walk through logging design: one mission per line; or CSV.

**1-hour work:**

* Students integrate file logging into **Robot Parts Collection** or a new "mission".
* Stretch: compute mission success rate from the file.
