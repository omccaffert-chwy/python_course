# Day 18 – Algorithms on a Grid (uses concepts from Udemy Days 4–6, 18–21)

**Udemy days to **review** (no new Udemy day, just reuse):**

* **Day 5** – loops & range
* **Day 6** – functions & while loops
* **Day 18–19** – turtle + coordinates
* **Day 20–21** – collision and movement.

**Robotics project:**
🛠 **Pathfinding on a Grid (Intro to Algorithms)**

* Represent a grid with obstacles as a 2D list.
* Implement **simple BFS or greedy walk** from start to goal.
* Visualize steps in console or optional turtle.

**1-hour lesson:**

* Introduce idea of an algorithm and big-O informally.
* Walk through BFS conceptually on a small grid.

**1-hour work:**

* Students code a simple search (even if not fully optimal).
* Stretch: count number of steps and compare paths.
