# Day 1 – Intro to Python, Variables & I/O (Udemy Day 1–2)

**Udemy days to assign:**

* **Day 1** – Printing, input, variables, band name generator

You can download the real projects from Udemy day 1 lesson 5 in the DO NOT SKIP section. For our purposes, this doesn't matter but if you want all the real projects, go ahead and setup Pycharm to get them!

If this section is too easy for you (or you learn via doing), skip it and blaze to the project. I sort of recommend this for all the lessons, I think doing by learning is one of the best ways to learn.
* **Day 2 (first half)** – Data types, basic math, f-strings, Tip Calculator

**Robotics project (replace Band Name / Tip Calculator):**
🛠 **Robot Name & Battery Estimator**

* Take user input for "robot base name" and a few specs (battery capacity, power draw).
* Compute how many hours of operation it can run and print formatted results.
  (Concepts: input, print, variables, data types, f-strings.)

**1-hour lesson:**

* Walk through core videos from Day 1 and early Day 2 (up to f-strings).
* Live-code a simple "robot greeter" that asks user's name and prints a welcome from the robot.

**1-hour work:**

* Students follow your spec to build the **Robot Name & Battery Estimator**.
* Stretch: allow multiple robots and compute which lasts longest.
