# Day 9 – Collisions & Game State (Udemy Day 20–21)

**Udemy days to assign:**

* **Day 20–21** – Snake game setup, OOP snake, collisions, score.

**Robotics project (replace Snake):**
🛠 **Robot Parts Collection Game**

* Treat "snake" as a robot that must collect spare parts.
* Colliding with wall/obstacle or its own previous path = mission fail.
* Same concepts: movement, collisions, score.

**1-hour lesson:**

* Focus on: collision detection, keeping state in lists (segments).
* Discuss how this relates to real robots avoiding obstacles and self-collision (arms).

**1-hour work:**

* Students adapt the Snake code into **Parts Collection Game**.
* Stretch: add difficulty levels (faster movement, more obstacles).
