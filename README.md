welcome to the course

feel free to install pycharm and do find the real lesson's materials in there.
Not necessary, as the projects are in this repo that will be good to do otherwise.

I spent time creating this (AI helped obv) but its good and I expect you to take time to do it as well. It should help you become more confident with coding, by not only learning some basic -> intermedate technicies but also with the time this will take. More time practicing, failing, etc -> the more you will learn and the more your confidence will grow. Like anything else, this will be challenging at times.

RULES:

use git for everything. I expect each project to be checked up to your repo. use git add, git commit -m, and git push to cleanly add code to a repo of your own.

before each project in this repo, do the assigned lectures on Udemy. These projects should not take you too long to code, if they do, you probably missed a lecture. If you are stuck however, contact me or look online for some help.

However, do NOT use AI. Google's auto ai search is fine but NO ChatGPT and NO Cursor.

DISABLE AUTOCOMPLETE. autocomplete or the Cursor chat window will do these projects instantly and you will learn nothing. I did not spend time creating this for AI to complete these projects for you. I expect you to do it yourself completely (or ask a human/google for help :)

Open Cursor Settings (Ctrl + Shift + J)

Go to 'Tab'

Disable Cursor Tab

If you think a lesson is too easy for you, great. Do it anyways. The more time you have coding without AI, the more your confidence will grow.

These projects will greatly increase your python abilities, and are in a similar style to LeetCode, which is the standard for technicial interviews if you ever need that in the future.

When you implement a fuction in the projects, run the test file in the terminal or just by hiting the run button 
(its an arrow on the top right that says 'run python file' when you hover over it)

The tests will either pass or fail and based on why it failed, this will give you a clue to what you did wrong. Note: these tests were AI generated so may not be accurate to every edge case.


todo me:
- in test error messages, add what test number threw error
- add in snippbet about a test.py file anyone can run and test any lines of python they want. The best way to test things


concepts covered:
- first half of days is a getting you used to what a 'robot' is and how one would move around a simple 2-d environment
-> if you wanna work on the behavior system, collision avoidance systems etc.
- 2nd half is input/output data flow from csv, rosbag, etc. to get data in. reformat it, and output it to another source like hugging face.
-> this has you creating abstact classes, doing coding design,


Lecture 1: how to be a good programmer. Always learning new tech. Almost never comfortable. You guys will have to do LOTS of stuff that you will have to figure out. Be curious about what is happening under the hood, not just how to get it done. This will help you by MILES. then you can talk about the tech and understand it better.
- Course overview. Subject to change. If you are not learning, please tell me and we can change things.
lectures on:
git
running python, venv setup, init module, path

how to design a problem (later on)

- day 1-5: loops, functions, lists, if/else, strings, dicts, etc.
- day 6- large logic project: maybe skip.
- day 7- OOD classes, fields. creating robot class
- day 8- onkey, turtle game. maybe skip
- day 9- snake game: maybe skip
- day 10- read write from files
- day 11- getting data from csv
- day 12- parsing strings into list stuff, dicts etc. maybe skip. 
- day 13- GUI, maybe skip
- Exceptions and Error handling day 14
- Debugging day 15
- learning + using API's day 16
- day 17: git stuff. skip and do from the beginning
- day 18: BFS grid project. skip
- day 19: full robot OOD project w/ grid, waypoints, robots, etc.
- day 20: capstone. choose between better robot sim or data tool.
Change into the full data project that liv wants? Multi input -> ABC classes -> multioutput (hugging face, csv)
