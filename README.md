welcome to the course

feel free to install pycharm and do find the real lesson's materials in there.
Not necessary, as the projects are in this repo that will be good to do otherwise.

I spent time creating this (AI helped obv) but its good and I expect you to take time to do it as well. It should help you become more confident with coding, by not only learning some basic -> intermedate technicies but also with the time this will take. More time practicing, failing, etc -> the more you will learn and the more your confidence will grow. Like anything else, this will be challenging at times.

RULES:

use git for everything. I expect each project to be checked up to your repo. use git add, git commit -m, and git push to cleanly add code to a repo of your own.

before each project in this repo, do the assigned lectures on Udemy. These projects should not take you too long to code, if they do, you probably missed a lecture. If you are stuck however, contact me or look online for some help.

However, do NOT use AI. Google's auto ai search is fine but NO ChatGPT and NO Cursor.

DISABLE AUTOCOMPLETE. autocomplete or the Cursor chat window will do these projects instantly and you will learn nothing. I did not spend time creating this for AI to complete these projects for you. I expect you to do it yourself completely (or ask a human/google for help :)

If you think a lesson is too easy for you, great. Do it anyways. The more time you have coding without AI, the more your confidence will grow.

These projects will greatly increase your python abilities, and are in a similar style to LeetCode, which is the standard for technicial interviews if you ever need that in the future.
