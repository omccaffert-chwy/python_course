# Day 8 – OOP + Turtle = 2D Robot Simulator (Udemy Day 18–19)

**Udemy days to assign:**

* **Day 18** – Turtle basics, shapes, random walk, spirograph
* **Day 19** – Turtle coordinate system, event listeners.

**Robotics project (replace art projects & Etch-a-Sketch):**
🛠 **Turtle Robot Grid Navigator**

* Represent robot as a turtle.
* Arrow keys move the robot on screen.
* Optionally draw its path as it "patrols".

**1-hour lesson:**

* Introduce turtle as simple robot simulator.
* Explain coordinate system and event listeners (`onkey`).

**1-hour work:**

* Students complete **Grid Navigator**.
* Stretch: add obstacles (drawn rectangles) and detect collisions by coordinates.
