🤖 Robot Patrol Route Generator

This project teaches:
- Lists and indexing
- The random module (random.choice, random.shuffle, random.randint)
- For loops and range()
- Building strings from lists

Your Task:
----------
Complete the five functions below:

1. get_random_waypoint(waypoints)
   - Pick a random waypoint from a list using random.choice()

2. shuffle_route(waypoints)
   - Randomize the order of waypoints using random.shuffle()

3. generate_patrol_route(waypoints, num_stops)
   - Build a patrol route by randomly selecting waypoints

4. calculate_total_steps(route)
   - Use a for loop to count total steps in a route

5. format_route_report(route)
   - Use a for loop to build a formatted route report string

Waypoints:
----------
Waypoints are represented as tuples: (name, steps_to_reach)
Example: ("Entrance", 0), ("Lab A", 15), ("Storage", 22)

The 'steps_to_reach' represents how many steps from the starting point.
