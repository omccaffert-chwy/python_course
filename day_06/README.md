# Day 6 – Larger Logic Project (Udemy Day 11 or 12)

**Udemy days to assign:**

* **Day 11** – Blackjack game (logic heavy, lists, functions), OR
* **Day 12** – Number Guessing Game.

**Robotics project (replace Blackjack / Guessing Game):**
🛠 **Robot Energy Management Game**

* Simulate a robot that must complete tasks but has limited battery.
* Each task costs energy; user chooses which tasks to accept.
* If battery runs out mid-task, mission fails.

(Concepts mirror Blackjack's scoring logic and Number Guessing's looping and feedback.)

**1-hour lesson:**

* Review logic + functions + loops in a bigger project.
* Whiteboard state transitions: battery, tasks, success/failure.

**1-hour work:**

* Students implement **Energy Management Game**.
* Stretch: add "recharge station" tasks with trade-offs.

Our Blackjack Game House Rules
The deck is unlimited in size.
There are no jokers.
The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
The Ace can count as 11 or 1.
Use the following list as the deck of cards:
cards = [11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 10]

The cards in the list have equal probability of being drawn.
Cards are not removed from the deck as they are drawn.
The computer is the dealer.


number guessing game:

random number between 0-100 is picked and the user has 10 guesses to figure this out. This is a great game to create and play bc it helps you learn binary search.
