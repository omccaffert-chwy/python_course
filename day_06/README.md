# Day 6 – Larger Logic Project (Udemy Day 11 or 12)

**Udemy days to assign:**

* **Day 11** – Blackjack game (logic heavy, lists, functions), OR
* **Day 12** – Number Guessing Game.

**Robotics project (replace Blackjack / Guessing Game):**
🛠 **Robot Energy Management Game**

* Simulate a robot that must complete tasks but has limited battery.
* Each task costs energy; user chooses which tasks to accept.
* If battery runs out mid-task, mission fails.

(Concepts mirror Blackjack's scoring logic and Number Guessing's looping and feedback.)

**1-hour lesson:**

* Review logic + functions + loops in a bigger project.
* Whiteboard state transitions: battery, tasks, success/failure.

**1-hour work:**

* Students implement **Energy Management Game**.
* Stretch: add "recharge station" tasks with trade-offs.
